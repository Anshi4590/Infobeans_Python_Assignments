Cybercrime Log Analysis System

A cybersecurity company monitors encrypted login activity stored as character-based security logs.

During investigation, analysts need to identify the last character that repeats in the log sequence.
This helps detect the most recent duplicated activity pattern before a possible security breach.

Write a Python program to find the last repeating character in a given string.

If no repeating character exists, print:

No repeating character found
Input:
abccdbefga
Output:

n = input("Enter String : ")
fr = len(n) - 1

for i in range(len(n)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(n)):
        if n[i] == n[j]:
            if j >= fr:
                fr = j
            break
if fr == len(n) - 1:
   print("no repeating character")
   
else:
   print(n[fr])
