Neon Number Detector

Scenario:
A smart calculator system checks special numbers used in mathematical testing.
The user enters a range of numbers.
The system identifies all Neon Numbers using nested loops.

Theory:
A Neon Number is a number where the sum of digits of its square is equal to the original number.

Example:
9

Square of 9 = 81

8 + 1 = 9

Since the sum is equal to the original number, 9 is called a Neon Number.

Input:
Enter starting number: 1
Enter ending number: 100

Output:
Neon Numbers are:
1
9'''

a = int(input("Enter the number"))
b = int(input("Enter the number"))

for i in range(a,b+1):
   temp = i
   sum = 0
   square = i**2
   for j in range(len(str(square))):
        d = square%10
        sum = sum+d
        square = square//10
   if sum == temp:
      print(temp)
